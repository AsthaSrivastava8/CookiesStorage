Of all the time that cats have humbled us with their presence, we have observed one thing. They sure love to groom themselves. They lick their fur, scratch their body, and even rub against themselves.  But even for these individualistic creatures, a little help never hurt. 

If you ever plan a trip to the tub for your cat(or cats, 'cuz too many cats is not a thing), there are few pointers to keep in mind:
Cut the claws a day before to prevent yourself from hurting. 
 Keep your first session as short as 5-10 minutes. It gives time to the cat to understand what's happening and adjust. Also, the pet will get used to being handled. 
If it is showing any signs of distress, cut short the session, and try after some time. If needed, take the help of another person to hold and relax the cat. 
If the hair is short, keep the grooming session to once a week as these are generally very clean creatures.
Firstly, use a metal brush to untangle the hair and work through the fur from head to tail.
Then gently use a bristle brush to remove loose hair from the torso in an upward motion. 
To brush the tail, make a part in the middle and brush the fur out on either side.
Before all the wet business starts, make sure to put a rubber mat in the tub or sink to prevent the cat from slipping. 
Fill the tub or sink with 3-4 inches of lukewarm water. 
Wet the pet's body except for its eyes, nose and ears. 
Gently massage in shampoo, working from head to tail.
Keep an eye for any signs of distress and prevent the shampoo from entering eyes, nose and ears. 
Thoroughly wash off the shampoo with lukewarm water. Make sure none of the shampoo is left. 
Finally, dry the cat with a large clean towel. 

And Voila! Your pretty kitty is ready to rule over the world once again.  

Pro tip: To make the experience better, bring a waterproof toy to distract the cat.
