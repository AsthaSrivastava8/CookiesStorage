Quarantine: Pets Edition
Everyone wishes to spend most of their time with best friends. And the fun is doubled when that friend is a furry munchkin. Now of all times, is really hard for all of us, and our pets are no different. But the silver lining of this dark cloud is that we can spend a lot of time with them. Here are some tips on how to take care of your pooch during these unusual times:
•	During quarantine, pets mostly spend their time inside the house with not much space to play. 
•	This lack of movement affects their physical and emotional health.
•	To keep them occupied, play games like hide and seek or a short version of fetch
•	You can try Instagram challenges like toilet paper challenge with your pet to increase their physical activity. 
•	Keep their weight in check by weighing them weekly. It is advised to reduce their food intake by 10%
•	 Teach them tricks like sit and roll over, sniff and retrieve objects, among others. 
•	Not only this, you can keep yourself healthy by running back and forth between two points in your house with your pet. As it is rightly said (by me), all play with your boy, makes work out all joy.  
•	Keep track of their food supplies and medication since most of the places would be closed. Stock up all the necessities to last for at least 15 days. 
•	Keep track of all the vaccinations the pet has due. Talk with your vet 2 weeks in advance to avoid any last-minute rush. 
•	Keep a first aid kit for the pet at home and collect some information about treating basic injuries like ingesting foreign substances or hurting their limbs. 
•	Keep tabs on what they are putting in their mouth. Don’t let them chew on any unknown thing. 
•	Make sure their chew toys are clean and sanitized. 
•	Keep their bed clean. Groom them as usual but make sure to include antibacterial products in their routine. 
•	Avoid giving them stale food as it might compromise their immunity. Their food should be thoroughly cooked and given shortly after being prepared. 
•	Lastly don’t forget to keep their dishes squeaky clean. 
An added advantage of this quarantine is WFH, another reason to curl up with your bundle of joy. If you are busy, they would just go about their business. But would be on your side when you need to rant about the boss or a colleague. They can be the best work friend you never had!
And in the end, after a hard day’s work, nothing can compare to cuddling up with your buddy and have a good night’s sleep.
